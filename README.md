# Py_Stenography
Small python tool for stenography.

Can encode (PNG and JPG to PNG) and decode (PNG) basic LSB stenography inside images.

## Examples
Some example images are provided in the `examples` folder.

Images ending in `mod` are images with hidden messages in them, others are the originals.

## Next on the list
Expand the script to be able to do more advanced stenography.

Maybe add better support for JPG images.
